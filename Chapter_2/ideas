If I had infinite programming skills, what would I build? That is really the question that I need to find the answer to. I really does 
seem like I want to be able to code, because I really like doing things on the keyboard. It has always been something that I enjoy.
It makes me feel like I am doing something cool.
	 Building an app seems like it would be something fun to do.
	I would like to be able to run my home network. Identify everything that is in the environment. Be able to view it all from my ph	phone or in the cloud. Ensuring that everything is secure.
	I would also like to be able to do some automation. Collecting reports and have seem presenting in a nice clean way.
I will hopefully update this file when I come up with new ideas of things to build or try
